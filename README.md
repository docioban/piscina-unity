# Unity Piscine 42 - Progress & Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains my progress, projects, and exercises completed during the **Unity Piscine School 42** program. My journey with Unity began here, and I am continuously updating this repository as I advance through the curriculum.

## About the Program

**Piscine Unity School 42** is an intensive program designed to introduce and develop skills in Unity game development. It covers a wide range of topics, from the basics of game creation to more advanced features and techniques used in professional game development.
